    "## Homework 1\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "The goal of HW1 is for you to get familiar with extracting features and standard machine learning workflows, including reading data, preprocessing data, training, testing, and evaluation. All those are open questions and there is no fixed solution. The difference in data processing, parameter initialization, data split, etc, will lead to the differences in final predications and evaluation results. Therefore, during the grading, the specific values in the results are not important. It is important that you focus on implementing the functions and setting up the pipelines.\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "The dataset is about the product review dataset from Amazon. Please download it from Canvas. The dataset provides product reviews and overall ratings for 4,195 products. We will consider the fine-grained overall ratings as labels, which are ranging from 1 to 5: highly negative, negative, neutral, positive, and highly positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task: Sentiment Abalysis with Text Classification\n",
    "Based on the dataset, the task is to perform sentiment analysis, which predicts the sentiments based on the free-text reviews. You can solve the task as a multi-class classification problem (5 classes in total). You can also simplify the task as a binary classification problem. Specifically, we will consider the rating 4 and 5 as positive, and rating 1 and 2 as negative. For data samples with neutral rating 3, you can discard them or simply consider them as either positive or negative samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "***In the submission, please make sure to clearly mention which task you are solving and how did you prepare the class labels.***"
