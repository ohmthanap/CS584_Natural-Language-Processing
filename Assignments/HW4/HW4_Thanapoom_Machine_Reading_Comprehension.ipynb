        "The goal of HW4 is for you to get hands-on experience of utilizing pre-trained and large language model for the machine reading comprehension task. The questions are open questions and there is no fixed solution. Different data selection and processing, parameter initialization, data split strategies will lead to different predictions and results. Therefore, during the grading, the specific values in the results are not required. It is important that you focus on implementing and setting up the pipelines of applying these models to solve the tasks."
